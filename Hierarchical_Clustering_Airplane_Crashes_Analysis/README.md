Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering - Airplane Crashes Data

This project applies Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering on the Airplane Crashes dataset to identify natural groups using unsupervised machine learning. Since the dataset does not contain a target variable, the objective is to automatically group similar crash events based only on the selected numerical features. The three features used for clustering are Aboard (number of people onboard), Fatalities (number of deaths), and Ground (number of people killed on the ground). These features help categorize airplane crash events based on the severity and overall impact of the incident.

Feature scaling was applied before modeling to ensure equal contribution of each feature to distance calculations. A dendrogram was constructed to visually determine the optimal number of clusters, and to make the structure easier to interpret, a sample of 200 records was used for visualization. By identifying the largest vertical gap in the dendrogram, the optimal number of clusters was found to be two. The Agglomerative Hierarchical Clustering model was then trained using the Ward linkage method, which merges clusters while minimizing internal variance. After training, the cluster labels were assigned to each data point using the fit_predict() function.

This project demonstrates the full workflow of hierarchical clustering, including data preparation, scaling, dendrogram interpretation, optimal cluster selection, training the clustering model, and assigning group labels to the dataset.
